# Important decisions

Many decisions need to be made when choosing to build a system as a solution.
Although certain decisions matter more to some than to others, communicating
"important" decisions is a key function of onboarding and ongoing
collaboration.

All of the "important" decisions for this project are organized under this
directory starting with the decision to ["record important decisions"](./record-important-decisions.md).
