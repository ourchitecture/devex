# Refer to DevEx as Development Experience

## Context and Problem Statement

The industry began using DevEx to refer to "Developer Experience". While critically valid to focus on the developer's experience, it has been Our experience that an inclusive focus on the many roles on a development team as well as the team's stakeholders yields better results than focusing on developers alone.

## Considered Options

* "Developer Experience" (DevEx) - avoid the "not invented here" mentality and adopt the existing term
* "Development Experience" (DevEx) - Fork the idea and customize it to be more inclusive
* Invent a new term

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Development Experience" because it fulfills the intentions of DevEx, but remains more inclusive of a team's concerns than the single role of developer in an organization.
